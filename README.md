# Airflow

This is my own personal local setup for Apache Airflow. I plan to launch it, write some DAGs to explore the latest version 2.0 release of airflow, and then tear it down all through docker compose or probably minikube.

## Running this code

Run `./up.sh` to start it up.
Run `./down.sh` to bring it down.
